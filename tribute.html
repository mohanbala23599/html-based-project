            <p align = "center"><strong>Karunanidhi</strong> was born on 3 June 1924, in the village of <em>Thirukkuvalai in Nagapattinam district</em>, Madras Presidency, to Ayyadurai (Grand father) Muthuvel and Anjugam. He had two elder sisters, <em>Periyanayaki and Shanmugasundar</em>i. There was some misconception that his birth name was <strong>Dhakshinamoorthy</strong>, later changed to Karunanidhi as influenced by Dravidian and rationalist movements, Karunanidhi himself stated that <strong>C.N. Annadurai</strong> asked him to keep his birthname <strong>"Karunanidhi"</strong>, since it is already popular among the people. In his own writings Karunanidhi said that his family were of the Devadasi (renamed as Isai Vellalar) caste, a small community that traditionally played musical instruments at ceremonial occasions</p>
